# Bootstrap Web Page

## Link G.O.A.T

### Project Description
This is an idea I've had for an affiliate marketing site. It wasn't exactly along these lines but the name link GOAT was the main characteristic of my idea and the seed for this project. Just to have a little fun, I decided to morph it into the weirdest sites on the internet. The websites are all real, and I've visited all of them to ensure they're not going to leave viruses on your computers...I hope not at least. 

The parts of the assignment are not in order to improve the flow of the website. Many of the elements on the website were derived from Bootstrap's website, in the examples section. I worked through much of the project and hit a wall before I resorted to using the examples. I created the form on my own, the table and the nav bar, but when I got to the footer, I was having some difficulty. I went to the examples on Bootstrap's site and used the inspect feature of the developers tools to copy the formatting that was present. I still had to modify it significantly within the HTML, by adding CSS styling, and by adding media queries. 

### Note to graders
The easiest way to tackle the grading would be to condense the sections below the comments. I have some notes in there for myself as well, as i plan to modify this site later and actually host it, once we learn javascript and SQL. 


#### Challenges
Bootstrap provides beautiful styling but adds another layer of complexity to the code. There is a significant amount of inline styling using bootstrap classes, external styling with CSS, and specificity played a large part in the styling as well. I struggled a bit with properly targeting the classes and had to create unique id's in some cases to help with targeting. The next set of challenges came with the various breakpoints. I had to figure out the situations in which I had different column formats for the same elements based on breakpoints such as col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-8 as an example. This project broke me at one point and I had to step back, create a new file and add back elements one by one to achieve the proper sizing, and layout to account for the numerous issues I ran into. Overall I really had fun with the project. The challenges to me are a huge part of the enjoyment and I look forward to completing this project by adding the relevant pages, adding javascript, and an SQL database to make the site live, although I may change the theme back to what was originally intended.
